# Quick Intro to Text Analysis in R

This workshop is for SICSS-Chicago 2021

## Getting R Setup

### I have R installed

If you have R and RStudio installed on your computer, great - use that.  We'll need a few packages:

```r
install.packages()
```

These can take a while to install if you don't already have these packages.  If prompted to compile anything, or any questions about "source", choose no.

You also want to download the files in this repository.  See [Downloading from GitHub](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/).  Find the file you downloaded, unzip it, then double click on `r-text-quick.Rproj` to open the project in RStudio.  

### I don't have R installed

You can 1) [Install R and RStudio](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/), or 2) use [RStudio Cloud online](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/#option-2-rstudio-cloud). If you install R/RStudio, then follow the instructions above once it's installed. 

If you are using RStudio Cloud, when you set up the project, use the URL for this GitHub repository, which is: ``  This will copy the files over for you.

In RStudio Cloud, you need to install packages.  Run this code in the console:

```r
install.packages()
```

It will take a while to run.  If prompted to compile anything, or any questions about "source", choose no.
